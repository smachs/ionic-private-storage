A **boilerplate** for **Ionic**, **Angular**, **Firebase**, **AWS**, **Google Cloud Storage**, **Cordova**, and **Sass**. With the continued expansion of the **Internet** entrust the integrity of _corporate secrets_, _corporate projects_, _documents_, _musics_, _books_, _personal files_ and _family files_ to an outsourced _cloud hosting services_ that can be **rigged** and **hacked**, it is an unfair risk to be taken for **anyone** who desires a **high consistency** in the **reliability** of their **files** have your own file system **centralized** using **AWS** and **Google Cloud** Storage that in the annual reports **presented** data of **0.03%** of **file loss**, therefore have your **own file manager** connected to the **AWS** or **Google Cloud Storage** and upload and download files using your the **third party integrations** you want. Forget the **several hours** trying to **centralize** your **files** and **backup** using _cloud hosting services_ have your **own** file station synchronized in **multi-platform** using **rules** and **cryptographies** created by yourself.
